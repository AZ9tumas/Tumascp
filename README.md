# Tumascp
This is my own programming language.
Btw, Makefile works only on linux.

Use the following commands in order to start scripting in tumascp:
1. `make`
2. `./tumascp`

For executing a file, do `./tumascp file_name`

This project is under development, syntax and grammar will be shared when done.
